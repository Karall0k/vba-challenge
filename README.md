# vba-challenge
This repository contains files submitted by Karesse Lockard for Module 2 Challenge for the RU Data Science Bootcamp.
The code was created using in class materials and code sourced from the website https://github.com/shrawantee/VBA-Scripting---Stock-Market-Analysis/blob/master/HW2_Challenge_DS.vbs.
I had trouble getting the code to work for the Greatest % Increase, Decrease, and Volume Sumamry table so that code was ommitted.
